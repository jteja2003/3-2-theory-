## 1. Define Simpson's Paradox
**Simpson's Paradox** is a phenomenon in statistics where a trend that appears in several different groups of data reverses when the groups are combined. This occurs because the combined data hides the influence of a confounding variable, which skews the results. For example, a medication might appear to be more effective in both men and women when looked at separately, but less effective when data from both groups is combined.

## 2. Define Correlation
**Correlation** is a statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables are linearly related. It is quantified by the correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1. A correlation of 1 means the variables move together perfectly, -1 means they move in opposite directions perfectly, and 0 means there is no linear relationship.

## 3. Write a brief note on Causation
**Causation** indicates that one event is the result of the occurrence of the other event; there is a cause-and-effect relationship. Establishing causation is complex and usually requires controlled experiments or longitudinal studies to rule out other factors and confirm that changes in one variable directly result in changes in another variable.

## 4. What is Conditional Probability
**Conditional probability** is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. For example, if we want to know the probability of someone having a disease given that they have tested positive for it, this is a conditional probability. It is calculated using the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \).

## 5. Define Hypothesis and Inference
- **Hypothesis**: A hypothesis is a proposed explanation or prediction that can be tested through study and experimentation. For instance, "Exercise reduces the risk of heart disease" is a hypothesis.
- **Inference**: Inference is the process of drawing conclusions about a population based on data from a sample. It involves methods like estimating parameters, testing hypotheses, and making predictions.

## 6. Write a short note on Confidence Intervals
**Confidence intervals** provide a range of values within which we expect the true population parameter to fall, with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%). For example, if a 95% confidence interval for the mean height of a population is 150-160 cm, we are 95% confident that the true mean height lies within this range.

## 7. Define Bayes Theorem
**Bayes Theorem** is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities. It is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. The formula is \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \), where \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event A given that B is true.

## 8. What is Hypothesis Testing
**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical method that uses sample data to evaluate a hypothesis about a population parameter. The process involves:
- Formulating a null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) and an alternative hypothesis (\( H_a \)).
- Selecting a significance level (alpha).
- Calculating a test statistic from the sample data.
- Comparing the test statistic to a critical value to decide whether to reject \( H_0 \).

## 9. Give a brief note on Random Variables
**Random variables** are quantities that can take on different values due to the outcome of a random phenomenon. They can be:
- **Discrete**: Can take on a countable number of values (e.g., number of students in a class).
- **Continuous**: Can take on any value within a range (e.g., height of students).

## 10. What are the different operations performed on Matrices
- **Addition**: Summing corresponding elements of two matrices.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracting corresponding elements of one matrix from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplying corresponding elements (element-wise) or performing matrix multiplication (dot product).
- **Transpose**: Flipping a matrix over its diagonal.
- **Inversion**: Finding a matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, yields the identity matrix.
- **Determinant calculation**: A scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix, providing important properties of the matrix.

## 11. What is the shape of a Normalization Curve?
The shape of a **normalization curve**, often referring to a normal distribution curve, is **bell-shaped**. This curve is symmetrical around the mean, with most of the data points clustering around the central peak, and the probabilities tapering off equally in both directions away from the mean.

# UNIT-2

1. **Train/Test Split in Machine Learning:**
   - **Train/Test Split** refers to dividing a dataset into two subsets: one for training a machine learning model and one for testing its performance. Typically, 70-80% of the data is used for training, and 20-30% is reserved for testing. This helps in evaluating how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

2. **Types of Machine Learning:**
   - **Supervised Learning**: Models are trained on labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).

   - **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Uses both labeled and unlabeled data.
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Models learn by interacting with an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

3. **Linear Regression:**
   - **Linear Regression** is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more input features. It models the relationship between the input variables and the output by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

4. **Logistic Regression:**
   - **Logistic Regression** is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. Unlike linear regression, it predicts the probability of a binary outcome using the logistic (sigmoid) function. The output is a probability that can be mapped to two classes (e.g., spam or not spam).

5. **Regularization Techniques:**
   - **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**
   - **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**
   - **Elastic Net**: A combination of L1 and L2 regularization.

   - **Classification errors** are mistakes made by a classification model. Common types include:
     - **False Positives (Type I Error)**: Incorrectly predicting the positive class.
     - **False Negatives (Type II Error)**: Incorrectly predicting the negative class.

8. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes. SVM aims to maximize the margin between the closest points of the classes (support vectors).

9. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN):**
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. For a given data point, K-NN identifies the k-nearest points in the training set and makes a prediction based on the majority class (for classification) or average value (for regression) of these neighbors. It is non-parametric and lazy, meaning it makes decisions based on the entire dataset and does not train an explicit model.

10. **Difference Between K-NN and K-Means:**
    - **K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**:
      - Instance-based learning algorithm.
      - Used for classification and regression.
      - Makes predictions based on the closest k instances in the training data.
      - Non-parametric and lazy (no explicit training phase).
    - **K-Means**:
      - Clustering algorithm.
      - Used for unsupervised learning to partition data into k clusters.
      - Iteratively assigns data points to clusters and updates cluster centroids.
      - Parametric and has a distinct training phase to determine cluster centers.
