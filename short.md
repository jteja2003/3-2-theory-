## 1. Define Simpson's Paradox
**Simpson's Paradox** is a phenomenon in statistics where a trend that appears in several different groups of data reverses when the groups are combined. This occurs because the combined data hides the influence of a confounding variable, which skews the results. For example, a medication might appear to be more effective in both men and women when looked at separately, but less effective when data from both groups is combined.

## 2. Define Correlation
**Correlation** is a statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables are linearly related. It is quantified by the correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1. A correlation of 1 means the variables move together perfectly, -1 means they move in opposite directions perfectly, and 0 means there is no linear relationship.

## 3. Write a brief note on Causation
**Causation** indicates that one event is the result of the occurrence of the other event; there is a cause-and-effect relationship. Establishing causation is complex and usually requires controlled experiments or longitudinal studies to rule out other factors and confirm that changes in one variable directly result in changes in another variable.

## 4. What is Conditional Probability
**Conditional probability** is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. For example, if we want to know the probability of someone having a disease given that they have tested positive for it, this is a conditional probability. It is calculated using the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \).

## 5. Define Hypothesis and Inference
- **Hypothesis**: A hypothesis is a proposed explanation or prediction that can be tested through study and experimentation. For instance, "Exercise reduces the risk of heart disease" is a hypothesis.
- **Inference**: Inference is the process of drawing conclusions about a population based on data from a sample. It involves methods like estimating parameters, testing hypotheses, and making predictions.

## 6. Write a short note on Confidence Intervals
**Confidence intervals** provide a range of values within which we expect the true population parameter to fall, with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%). For example, if a 95% confidence interval for the mean height of a population is 150-160 cm, we are 95% confident that the true mean height lies within this range.

## 7. Define Bayes Theorem
**Bayes Theorem** is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities. It is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. The formula is \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \), where \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event A given that B is true.

## 8. What is Hypothesis Testing
**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical method that uses sample data to evaluate a hypothesis about a population parameter. The process involves:
- Formulating a null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)) and an alternative hypothesis (\( H_a \)).
- Selecting a significance level (alpha).
- Calculating a test statistic from the sample data.
- Comparing the test statistic to a critical value to decide whether to reject \( H_0 \).

## 9. Give a brief note on Random Variables
**Random variables** are quantities that can take on different values due to the outcome of a random phenomenon. They can be:
- **Discrete**: Can take on a countable number of values (e.g., number of students in a class).
- **Continuous**: Can take on any value within a range (e.g., height of students).

## 10. What are the different operations performed on Matrices
- **Addition**: Summing corresponding elements of two matrices.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracting corresponding elements of one matrix from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplying corresponding elements (element-wise) or performing matrix multiplication (dot product).
- **Transpose**: Flipping a matrix over its diagonal.
- **Inversion**: Finding a matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, yields the identity matrix.
- **Determinant calculation**: A scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix, providing important properties of the matrix.

## 11. What is the shape of a Normalization Curve?
The shape of a **normalization curve**, often referring to a normal distribution curve, is **bell-shaped**. This curve is symmetrical around the mean, with most of the data points clustering around the central peak, and the probabilities tapering off equally in both directions away from the mean.

# UNIT-2

1. **Train/Test Split in Machine Learning:**
   - **Train/Test Split** refers to dividing a dataset into two subsets: one for training a machine learning model and one for testing its performance. Typically, 70-80% of the data is used for training, and 20-30% is reserved for testing. This helps in evaluating how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

2. **Types of Machine Learning:**

   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Models learn by interacting with an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

3. **Linear Regression:**
   - **Linear Regression** is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more input features. It models the relationship between the input variables and the output by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

4. **Logistic Regression:**
   - **Logistic Regression** is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. Unlike linear regression, it predicts the probability of a binary outcome using the logistic (sigmoid) function. The output is a probability that can be mapped to two classes (e.g., spam or not spam).

5. **Regularization Techniques:**
   - **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**

   - **Classification errors** are mistakes made by a classification model. Common types include:
     - **False Positives (Type I Error)**: Incorrectly predicting the positive class.
     - **False Negatives (Type II Error)**: Incorrectly predicting the negative class.

8. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes. SVM aims to maximize the margin between the closest points of the classes (support vectors).

9. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN):**
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. For a given data point, K-NN identifies the k-nearest points in the training set and makes a prediction based on the majority class (for classification) or average value (for regression) of these neighbors. It is non-parametric and lazy, meaning it makes decisions based on the entire dataset and does not train an explicit model.

10. **Difference Between K-NN and K-Means:**
    - **K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**:
      - Instance-based learning algorithm.
      - Used for classification and regression.
      - Makes predictions based on the closest k instances in the training data.
      - Non-parametric and lazy (no explicit training phase).
    - **K-Means**:
      - Clustering algorithm.
      - Used for unsupervised learning to partition data into k clusters.
      - Iteratively assigns data points to clusters and updates cluster centroids.
      - Parametric and has a distinct training phase to determine cluster centers.

# Vectors in Machine Learning

## Definition

Vectors are fundamental mathematical objects used to represent data in machine learning. A vector is essentially an ordered list of numbers, which can represent various data points or features in a multi-dimensional space. In machine learning, vectors are used to represent input features, model parameters, and other numerical data.

### Example
Consider a vector representing a data point with three features: height, weight, and age.
\[ \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 170 \\ 70 \\ 25 \end{pmatrix} \]

## Operations on Vectors

Here are some common operations performed on vectors in machine learning, along with examples:

1. **Addition:**
   - Adding two vectors involves adding their corresponding elements.
   - Example:
     \[
     \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
     \]
     \[
     \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + 4 \\ 2 + 5 \\ 3 + 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \\ 9 \end{pmatrix}
     \]

2. **Subtraction:**
   - Subtracting one vector from another involves subtracting their corresponding elements.
   - Example:
     \[
     \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
     \]
     \[
     \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 1 \\ 5 - 2 \\ 6 - 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
     \]

3. **Scalar Multiplication:**
   - Multiplying a vector by a scalar (a single number) scales each element of the vector by that number.
   - Example:
     \[
     \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad k = 3
     \]
     \[
     k \cdot \mathbf{a} = 3 \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 6 \\ 9 \end{pmatrix}
     \]

4. **Dot Product:**
   - The dot product of two vectors is a scalar value obtained by multiplying corresponding elements and summing the results.
   - Example:
     \[
     \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
     \]
     \[
     \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = (1 \cdot 4) + (2 \cdot 5) + (3 \cdot 6) = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32
     \]

5. **Cross Product (for 3-dimensional vectors):**
   - The cross product of two 3-dimensional vectors results in another 3-dimensional vector orthogonal to both.
   - Example:
     \[
     \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
     \]
     \[
     \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} (2 \cdot 6 - 3 \cdot 5) \\ (3 \cdot 4 - 1 \cdot 6) \\ (1 \cdot 5 - 2 \cdot 4) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 12 - 15 \\ 12 - 6 \\ 5 - 8 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ 6 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
     \]

6. **Magnitude (or Norm):**
   - The magnitude (or norm) of a vector is a measure of its length.
   - Example:
     \[
     \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
     \]
     \[
     \| \mathbf{a} \| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
     \]

## Applications in Machine Learning

Vectors are used extensively in machine learning for:
- Representing input features and output targets.
- Calculating distances in algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN).
- Transforming data in Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Optimizing weights in neural networks and other models. 

Understanding and manipulating vectors are crucial skills in the development and application of machine learning algorithms.
# Simpson’s Paradox

**Simpson’s Paradox** is a phenomenon in statistics where a trend observed in several different groups of data disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. This paradox highlights how aggregated data can sometimes lead to misleading conclusions, underscoring the importance of analyzing data at the correct level of granularity.

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Definition
Simpson's Paradox occurs when the association between two variables reverses or changes direction when a third variable (confounder) is introduced or when data is aggregated across different groups.

### 2. Mechanism
The paradox arises due to the presence of a confounding variable that has a different distribution across the groups being analyzed. When the data is aggregated, the confounding effect can overshadow the true relationship between the variables of interest.

## Example

Consider a hypothetical scenario involving the success rates of two treatments for a medical condition in two hospitals.

### Hospital A:
- **Treatment 1:** 70 out of 100 patients recover.
- **Treatment 2:** 20 out of 50 patients recover.

### Hospital B:
- **Treatment 1:** 30 out of 100 patients recover.
- **Treatment 2:** 80 out of 150 patients recover.

When we look at each hospital individually:

#### Hospital A:
- **Recovery rate for Treatment 1:** \( \frac{70}{100} = 70\% \)
- **Recovery rate for Treatment 2:** \( \frac{20}{50} = 40\% \)

#### Hospital B:
- **Recovery rate for Treatment 1:** \( \frac{30}{100} = 30\% \)
- **Recovery rate for Treatment 2:** \( \frac{80}{150} = 53.3\% \)

So, in each hospital separately, Treatment 1 has a higher recovery rate than Treatment 2.

However, if we combine the data from both hospitals:

### Combined Data:
- **Treatment 1:** \( 70 + 30 = 100 \) recoveries out of \( 100 + 100 = 200 \) patients.
- **Treatment 2:** \( 20 + 80 = 100 \) recoveries out of \( 50 + 150 = 200 \) patients.

The overall recovery rates are now:

- **Recovery rate for Treatment 1:** \( \frac{100}{200} = 50\% \)
- **Recovery rate for Treatment 2:** \( \frac{100}{200} = 50\% \)

In this combined view, both treatments appear to have the same recovery rate, obscuring the fact that Treatment 1 was better in both hospitals individually.

## Why it Happens
Simpson’s Paradox typically arises due to the presence of a lurking or confounding variable that affects the outcome. In the example above, the distribution of patients across hospitals and treatments was uneven, which influenced the aggregated results.

## Implications
Simpson's Paradox demonstrates the importance of:
- Carefully analyzing data by considering potential confounding variables.
- Avoiding drawing conclusions from aggregated data without understanding the underlying group-specific trends.
- Being cautious about interpreting statistical results, especially when combining data from different sources or groups.

## Real-World Applications
Simpson’s Paradox can appear in various fields such as:
- **Medical Studies:** Treatment effectiveness can appear different when looking at overall data versus stratified by age, gender, or severity of the condition.
- **Social Sciences:** Voting patterns can change when aggregated by different demographic factors.
- **Economics:** The impact of an intervention on income or employment can be misleading when not accounting for confounding factors like education level or geographical differences.

Understanding Simpson’s Paradox is crucial for correctly interpreting statistical data and making informed decisions based on that data.
# Statistical Hypothesis Testing Summary

## Definition
Statistical hypothesis testing is a method used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It involves testing an assumption (hypothesis) about a population parameter.

## Key Concepts

1. **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**
   - A statement of no effect or no difference.
   - Example: \(H_0: \mu = 50\) (The population mean is 50).

2. **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_a\) or \(H_1\))**
   - A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis.
   - Example: \(H_a: \mu \neq 50\) (The population mean is not 50).

3. **Test Statistic**
   - A standardized value calculated from sample data to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.
   - Examples: z-scores, t-scores, chi-square values.

4. **Significance Level (\(\alpha\))**
   - The probability threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, commonly set at 0.05.

5. **P-Value**
   - The probability of obtaining the observed test statistic under the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than or equal to \(\alpha\), reject \(H_0\).

## Steps in Hypothesis Testing

1. State the hypotheses (\(H_0\) and \(H_a\)).
2. Choose the significance level (\(\alpha\)).
3. Select the appropriate test.
4. Calculate the test statistic.
5. Determine the p-value.
6. Compare the p-value with \(\alpha\) and decide whether to reject \(H_0\).

## Types of Hypothesis Tests

1. **One-Sample Tests:** Compare the sample mean to a known value (e.g., one-sample t-test).
2. **Two-Sample Tests:** Compare means of two independent samples (e.g., two-sample t-test).
3. **Paired Sample Tests:** Compare means from the same group at different times (e.g., paired t-test).
4. **Proportion Tests:** Compare proportions (e.g., z-test for proportions).
5. **Chi-Square Tests:** Assess categorical data distributions (e.g., chi-square test for independence).
6. **ANOVA:** Compare means among three or more groups (e.g., one-way ANOVA).

## Example

Testing whether a new drug reduces blood pressure:
1. **\(H_0\):** The drug has no effect (\(\mu = 0\)).
2. **\(H_1\):** The drug has an effect (\(\mu \neq 0\)).
3. Use a paired t-test.
4. Calculate the t-score from the sample data.
5. Determine the p-value.
6. If the p-value < 0.05, reject \(H_0\).

## Summary
Statistical hypothesis testing helps in making data-driven decisions by testing hypotheses about population parameters based on sample data, using test statistics and p-values to determine the validity of the null hypothesis.
# P-Hacking

**P-hacking** refers to the practice of manipulating data analysis until nonsignificant results become significant. This often involves conducting multiple statistical tests or selectively reporting results that meet the threshold for statistical significance (usually p < 0.05). P-hacking undermines the integrity of statistical conclusions and can lead to false-positive results, which are findings that suggest an effect or association where none exists.

## Detailed Explanation

### Definition
P-hacking involves multiple strategies to artificially produce significant p-values, including selective reporting of results, data dredging, or making decisions about data analysis after looking at the data.

### Common Methods of P-Hacking
1. **Selective Reporting:** Only reporting experiments or data subsets that yield significant results.
2. **Data Dredging:** Conducting many statistical tests and only reporting the ones with significant results.
3. **Optional Stopping:** Stopping data collection once a significant result is found, rather than following a pre-specified plan.
4. **Transforming Data:** Applying data transformations or exclusions post hoc to achieve significant results.

## Example of P-Hacking

Imagine a researcher investigating the effect of a new drug on blood pressure. The researcher collects data from 100 patients and runs a statistical test, finding no significant effect (p = 0.08). To achieve a significant result, the researcher might:

1. **Data Subset Selection:**
   - Divide the data into subgroups (e.g., by age or gender) and test each subgroup separately. The researcher finds that the drug significantly reduces blood pressure in patients under 40 years old (p = 0.03) and reports this result, ignoring the overall non-significant finding.

2. **Changing Analysis Techniques:**
   - Initially using a t-test, the researcher switches to an ANOVA or a non-parametric test, which by chance shows a significant result (p = 0.04).

3. **Excluding Outliers:**
   - The researcher removes some data points deemed as outliers, which leads to a significant result (p = 0.02).

4. **Optional Stopping:**
   - Instead of collecting data from 200 planned patients, the researcher stops at 100 patients because the result is just significant (p = 0.049).

## Impact of P-Hacking

- **False Positives:** P-hacking increases the likelihood of finding false-positive results, suggesting effects or associations that do not exist.
- **Reproducibility Crisis:** It contributes to the reproducibility crisis in science, where many studies cannot be replicated or validated.
- **Misleading Conclusions:** Results obtained through p-hacking can mislead further research, policy decisions, and public perception.

## Preventing P-Hacking

- **Pre-registration:** Registering study designs, hypotheses, and analysis plans before conducting research.
- **Transparency:** Reporting all conducted analyses, including non-significant results.
- **Multiple Testing Correction:** Adjusting p-values for multiple comparisons to reduce the risk of false positives.
- **Replication:** Emphasizing the importance of replicating studies to confirm findings.

## Summary
P-hacking involves manipulating data analysis to obtain significant p-values, which undermines the validity of research findings. It can be mitigated through transparent and pre-registered research practices, as well as by correcting for multiple comparisons and emphasizing replication.
# Bayesian Inference

**Bayesian Inference** is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It provides a mathematical framework for integrating prior knowledge with new data to make statistical conclusions.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' theorem is the foundation of Bayesian inference. It relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula is:

\[
P(H|D) = \frac{P(D|H)P(H)}{P(D)}
\]

where:
- \( P(H|D) \) is the posterior probability, the probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the data \( D \).
- \( P(D|H) \) is the likelihood, the probability of the data given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability, the initial probability of the hypothesis before seeing the data.
- \( P(D) \) is the marginal likelihood, the probability of the data under all possible hypotheses.

### 2. Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))
Represents what is known about the hypothesis before observing the data. It can be based on previous studies, expert knowledge, or other sources of information.

### 3. Likelihood (\( P(D|H) \))
Represents how probable the observed data is under the hypothesis. It is the core of the data-generating process.

### 4. Posterior Probability (\( P(H|D) \))
Represents the updated probability of the hypothesis after considering the new data. It combines prior knowledge and the evidence provided by the data.

### 5. Marginal Likelihood (\( P(D) \))
Serves as a normalizing constant to ensure that the posterior probabilities sum to one. It is often computed by integrating over all possible hypotheses.

## Bayesian Inference Process

1. **Define the Prior:**
   - Specify the prior distribution \( P(H) \) based on prior knowledge or assumptions about the hypothesis.

2. **Collect Data:**
   - Obtain the observed data \( D \).

3. **Compute the Likelihood:**
   - Determine the likelihood \( P(D|H) \) of observing the data under different hypotheses.

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   - Use Bayes' theorem to update the prior distribution with the observed data, resulting in the posterior distribution \( P(H|D) \).

5. **Make Inferences:**
   - Use the posterior distribution to make probabilistic statements about the hypothesis or to make decisions.

## Advantages of Bayesian Inference

1. **Incorporates Prior Knowledge:**
   - Allows for the integration of prior information or expert knowledge with new data.

2. **Flexible and Iterative:**
   - Can be updated as new data becomes available, providing a dynamic and flexible approach to inference.

3. **Probabilistic Interpretation:**
   - Provides a natural and intuitive way to express uncertainty in model parameters and predictions.

4. **Handles Complex Models:**
   - Suitable for complex models where traditional methods might struggle, particularly in hierarchical or multi-level models.

## Applications of Bayesian Inference

1. **Medical Diagnosis:**
   - Updating the probability of disease presence based on test results and prior information.

2. **Machine Learning:**
   - Bayesian methods are used in various machine learning algorithms, including Bayesian networks and Gaussian processes.

3. **Economics and Finance:**
   - Updating economic models or financial predictions with new market data.

4. **Scientific Research:**
   - Incorporating prior studies and experimental data to refine hypotheses and models.

Bayesian inference provides a robust framework for statistical analysis, emphasizing the iterative and probabilistic nature of real-world data and decision-making.
# Matrices and Operations on Matrices

A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are fundamental in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, and machine learning. They are used to represent data, perform transformations, and solve systems of linear equations.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Matrix Notation
- A matrix is denoted by a capital letter (e.g., \(A\)) and its elements are denoted by \(a_{ij}\), where \(i\) is the row number and \(j\) is the column number.


### 2. Types of Matrices
- **Square Matrix:** A matrix with the same number of rows and columns.
- **Rectangular Matrix:** A matrix with different numbers of rows and columns.
- **Diagonal Matrix:** A square matrix where all off-diagonal elements are zero.
- **Identity Matrix:** A diagonal matrix with ones on the diagonal.
- **Zero Matrix:** A matrix where all elements are zero.
- **Transpose Matrix:** Denoted as \(A^T\), obtained by swapping rows and columns.

## Operations on Matrices

### 1. Addition and Subtraction
- Two matrices can be added or subtracted if they have the same dimensions.
- Element-wise operation: \(C = A + B\) means \(c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}\).



### 2. Scalar Multiplication
- Multiplying each element of a matrix by a scalar (constant).


### 3. Matrix Multiplication
- The product of two matrices \(A\) and \(B\) is defined if the number of columns in \(A\) equals the number of rows in \(B\). The result is a new matrix \(C\).


### 4. Transpose
- The transpose of a matrix \(A\), denoted \(A^T\), is obtained by swapping rows and columns.



### 5. Determinant
- A scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and encapsulates important properties of the matrix.


### 6. Inverse
- The inverse of a matrix \(A\), denoted \(A^{-1}\), is a matrix such that \(AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix.
- Not all matrices have inverses; a matrix must be square and have a non-zero determinant.



### 7. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- For a square matrix \(A\), an eigenvector \(v\) and corresponding eigenvalue \(\lambda\) satisfy \(Av = \lambda v\).
- Important in many applications, such as stability analysis and principal component analysis (PCA).

## Summary
Matrices are essential structures in linear algebra used extensively in various applications. Key operations include addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, transposition, calculation of determinants, finding inverses, and determining eigenvalues and eigenvectors. These operations enable complex data manipulation and transformation, essential in fields like machine learning, computer graphics, and scientific computing.
